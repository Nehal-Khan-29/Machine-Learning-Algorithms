# Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms

Unsupervised machine learning is a type of machine learning that deals with data without labeled responses. The goal is to explore the underlying structure of the data, identify patterns, and group similar data points.

## Key Concepts

1. **Clustering**: Grouping similar data points.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reducing the number of features while retaining important information.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying rare items or events that differ significantly from most of the data.

## Unsupervised Algorithms That This Folder Contains

### 1. K-Means Clustering

- **Description**: A popular clustering algorithm that partitions data into `K` distinct clusters based on feature similarity.
- **How it works**:
  - Initialize `K` centroids randomly.
  - Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.
  - Recalculate the centroids as the mean of assigned points.
  - Repeat until convergence.
- **Applications**: Customer segmentation, image compression, and market basket analysis.
